# hospital-database-project-info

School project to develop a hospital database that will manage the primary care operations.

Please email me at brandon.ines20@gmail.com to gain access to full repository for this project.  Due to it being a school project, I am unable to make it public.

Project Overview "A new hospital is being constructed to service the needs of a rapidly growing retirement community. You have been contracted to develop the database system that will manage the primary care operation of the hospital, but not the financial operation. The database system must have an easy to use interface that supports all the data entry and information gathering needs of the hospital."

The entire project document is located within the repository as "Project Scenario." In their, the projects deliverables and specifications can be found. For the project, I used SQLite to establish the database's tables and queries and used Java to crete a simple command-line interface.
